Computer vision algorithms include methods for acquiring, processing, analyzing and understanding digital images, and extraction of data from the real world. It is an interdisciplinary field that deals with how can computers gain a high-level understanding of digital images. It aims to mimic human vision.  
Convolutional neural networks are now capable of outperforming humans on some computer vision tasks,
such as classifying images.  
In this project, I provide a solution to the Landmark Recognition Problem. Given an input photo of a place anywhere around the world, the computer can recognize and label the landmark in which this image was taken.
